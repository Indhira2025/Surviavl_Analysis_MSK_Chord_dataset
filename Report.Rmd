## Construction of Time to Metastasis Outcome

Time to metastasis (TTM) was defined as the interval from the date of genomic sequencing (baseline; t=0) to the first documented metastatic progression event. Timeline-based longitudinal clinical records were used to define baseline disease status, identify incident metastatic events, and determine follow-up time.

### Definition of Baseline and At-Risk Cohort

Baseline was defined as the genomic sequencing date. To ensure inclusion of only patients at risk for future metastatic progression, the following exclusions were applied:

#### Metastasis prior to or at baseline

Patients with documented progression events (PROGRESSION = "Y") occurring at or before sequencing (START_DATE≤0 ) were excluded.

#### Metastatic disease at baseline diagnosis

Among diagnosis records occurring on or before sequencing ( START_DATE≤0), the most recent pre-sequencing stage was identified. Patients were excluded if they had: Stage IV disease, or

Documentation of distant/systemic disease at baseline.

#### No observable post-baseline follow-up

Patients whose last recorded clinical event occurred prior to sequencing were excluded, as they did not contribute post-baseline risk time.

The resulting analytic cohort consisted exclusively of patients who were metastasis-free at the time of genomic profiling and remained under observation thereafter

### Identification of Metastatic Events and Censoring

Post-baseline metastatic events were defined as progression records with:

PROGRESSION = "Y", and

START_DATE\>0.

For each patient 𝑖 , the earliest such event was taken as the incident metastasis time.

Patients without a post-baseline metastatic event were censored at their last recorded clinical event date (maximum START_DATE).

### Statistical Definition of the Time-to-Event Outcome


For each patient $i$, let

$$
T_i = \min(T_i^*, C_i)
$$

where $T_i^*$ denotes the true time from sequencing to metastatic progression, and $C_i$ denotes the censoring time (last recorded follow-up).

Define the event indicator as

$$
\delta_i =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } T_i^* \le C_i \quad (\text{metastasis observed}) \\
0 & \text{if } T_i^* > C_i \quad (\text{censored})
\end{cases}
$$

The observed time-to-metastasis outcome for patient $i$ is therefore represented as

$$
\text{Surv}(T_i, \delta_i),
$$

where $T_i \ge 0$ for all patients and time is measured in days from the date of genomic sequencing (baseline).



This construction ensured a well-defined risk set beginning at genomic sequencing, excluded prevalent metastatic disease, and minimized immortal time bias by anchoring follow-up at a biologically and clinically meaningful time origin.
